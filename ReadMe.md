# Codecademy Github Project 2 - Rebase

This is a small project completed during the "Learn Git & Github" course on [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-git/articles/github-rebase-off-platform-project). It's very basic, and not much is happening, but it allowed me to experiment with the rebase command. Below is the contents of the readme included with the original repository.

The repository includes a short children story. The story is in progress in various branches. The goal is to demonstrate the use of Git Rebase. If you would like to read the full version of the story, check out the link provided by the Department of CMES at University of Arizona: https://cmes.arizona.edu/sites/cmes.arizona.edu/files/e.%20The%20Little%20Black%20Fish%20-%20story_0.pdf
